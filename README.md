## Public Perceptions of AI on Education

This project explores how students view the growing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings. Using a 2023 Kaggle survey of over 1,200 students from around the world, I examined attitudes toward AI tools like ChatGPT, including their perceived benefits, risks, and ethical concerns.

The data was cleaned and analyzed using R. Key findings include strong support for AI-enhanced learning efficiency but notable concern about teacher replacement and grading fairness. STEM students were far more trusting of AI than their humanities peers. The goal is to help educators and policymakers better understand how students are responding to AI‚Äôs rise in classrooms.
